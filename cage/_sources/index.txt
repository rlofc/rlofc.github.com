Welcome to CAGE
===============

CAGE is an elementary game development library.
It was initially designed and developed to help teach 2D game
development using the C programming language.
CAGE prefers readability over flexibility and ease-of-use over
a rich feature set, in the spirit of **less is more**.

As a library, CAGE is just a thin layer on top of SDL2,
the Simple Direct-media Library. CAGE offers the essential
constructs for developing 2D games. It lets you handle images,
sprites, animations, fonts, sounds and other game-specific
entities using a clear and straighforward API.

The short version
-----------------

Here is one of the shortest and most boring game you can write using CAGE:

.. highlight:: c

::

    void* create(void)
    {
        return (void*)create_font("font.png");
    }

    void update(void* data, float elapsed_ms)
    {
        draw_text((font*)data, "Hello, World", xy(0, 0));
    }

    void destroy(void* data)
    {
        destroy_font((font*)data);
    }

    int main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
        return game_loop(create, update, destroy);
    }


Yes, there are easier ways to write games, and C may not look like
the best choice. There is no `but` here. LÃ–VE2D, HaxeFlixer and
Cocos2D are fine examples.

However, if you enjoy the beauty of C, if you want minimal cognitive burden
and if you want to have long-living, portable code, then CAGE could be
a viable option.
